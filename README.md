## UX

### Project goals

This project aims to help the _Lilac Lounge_ promote their business by producing an eye-catching website that will improve their online presence.

The target audience will be:

- venue-booking `customers`: anyone looking to hire out a venue
- prospective `patrons`: audience members who may want to see a show at the venue

#### `Customer` goals

Customers may be musicians or other entertainers looking to hire a venue where their fans can come to see them perform. They may also be people who are looking to hire a function room for a private event like a birthday party.

Customer goals are:

- Evaluating if the venue will be suitable for their needs
- Information relating to the physical characteristics of the venue, e.g. size, capacity, location
- Can easily contact the venue to make bookings

Beginning on the home page, the customer can see the upcoming events at the _Lilac Lounge_ which can help to give them an idea of kind of _vibe_ they may find.

Right after the events calendar there is a call-to-action directed at customers: a link to the Contact Us page that the customer can click if their interest is piqued.

The website will help the customer to achieve these goals because:

- the "Contact Us" page is clearly signposted on the home page, in addition to being linked to from the navigation bar
- information about the venue is summarised preceding the contact form on the "Contact Us" page
- the contact form is conveniently available there, for the customer to make further enquiries
- The Gallery will contain event photography showcasing the venue in action, which can serve to present the _Lilac Lounge_ as a well run popular venue

#### `Patron` goals

Patrons are people who will visit the venue to see a show or attend an event.

Patron goals are:

- To find out what's on at the _Lilac Lounge_
- To have a good time

The website will reassure patrons that the _Lilac Lounge_ will allow them to achieve these goals because:

- the event calendar on the homepage will show them at a glance the upcoming events at the venue
- the gallery shows images of people having a good time and invite patrons to come along to have a good too

#### Business goals

The _business_ is the _Lilac Lounge_.

The goals of the business are:

- raise the profile of the _Lilac Lounge_ as a music and events venue
- attract more customers
- attract more patrons

The website can help to achieve these objectives because:

- when so much is accessible online, having a compelling online presence is essential to allow a business to be seen
- customers and patrons go hand in hand:
  - If the venue is seen to be able to draw a higher number of patrons, then that can attract more (and perhaps more prestigious) customers, who can be reassured that the venue is able to accommodate their events and/or provide them with an audience.
  - If the venue attracts big names and puts on more events, it will generate buzz and attract more patrons

#### User Stories

As a customer, I want to:

1. know what kind of events the venue has had experience hosting
2. learn about the physical characteristics of the venue:
    - size
    - capacity
    - location
3. easily contact the venue to discuss hiring the venue

As a patron, I want to:

1. know what's on at the _Lilac Lounge_
2. know how to get to the venue
3. be reassured that I'll have a good time
